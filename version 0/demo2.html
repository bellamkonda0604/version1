                Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. A wider definition would
                include the
                design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape
                architecture
                to the microlevel of creating furniture.Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and
                cost for the builder, as well as function and
                aesthetics for the user. </p>

                Ceramic art is art made from ceramic materials, including clay. It may take forms including artistic
                pottery,
                including tableware, tiles, figurines and other sculpture. As one of the plastic arts, ceramic art is
                one of the
                visual arts. While some ceramics are considered fine art, as pottery or sculpture, most are considered
                to be
                decorative, industrial or applied art objects.
                Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology. Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a
                group of
                people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture and decorate the art
                ware.
                Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery". In a one-person pottery studio,
                ceramists or
                potters produce studio pottery.</p>

                Conceptual art, also referred to as conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in
                the
                work take precedence over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. Some works of
                conceptual art,
                sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written
                instructions</p>

                Drawing is a means of making an image, using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally
                involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface.
                Common
                tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax colour pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels,
                and
                markers.
                Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. An artist who excels in drawing is
                referred
                to as a drafter, draftswoman, or draughtsman. Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural
                industries such
                as illustrations, comics and animation. </p>

                Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision
                of the
                photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism, which provides a visual account for
                news
                events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services .

                Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. Drawing, gesture (as in
                gestural
                painting), composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art), among
                other
                aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.
                Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting),
                photographic,
                abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in
                nature
                (as in Artivism).</p>

                Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic
                arts.
                Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the
                addition of
                material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials; but since modernism, shifts in
                sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process.
                A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling,
                or
                moulded, or cast. </p>

                Dance (from Old French dancier, of unknown origin) generally refers to human movement either used as a
                form of
                expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting.
                Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or
                animals
                (e.g. bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (e.g. the leaves danced in the wind), and
                certain
                musical forms or genres.</p>

                Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are
                pitch
                (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation),
                dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture.
                The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and
                social
                context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance)
                through
                improvisational music to aleatoric pieces.
                Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between
                music
                genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial.
                Within
                "the arts", music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art </p>
