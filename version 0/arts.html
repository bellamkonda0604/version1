            The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form
            such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or
            emotional power. The art refers to the theory, human application and physical expression of
            creativity found in human cultures and societies through skills and imagination in order to produce
            objects, environments and experiences.</p>

            Major constituents of the arts include visual arts (including architecture, ceramics, drawing, filmmaking,
            painting, photography, and sculpting), literary arts (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose),
            performing arts (including dance, music, and theatre), and culinary arts (including cooking, choclate making
            and winemaking). Some arts forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. cinematography), or artwork
            with written
            word (e.g. comics). From prehistoric cave paintings to modern-day films, art serves as a vessel for
            storytelling and conveying humankinds's relationship with the environment.

        Arts education is in crisis. In school time and budgets are under pressure and
        school inspections increasingly value ‘core’ subjects as the indicators of school level and success. Subjects
        including art, music and drama are often sidelined in the curriculum. This has led to a steady decline in the
        number of students choosing to study arts subjects at school.

        School in general is so stressful…
        this is the one lesson I look forward to every week because
        I know it’s not going to majorly stress me out.

        [School is] all very robotic.
        It’s all very, it needs to be this, this and this.
        You can’t do this because it is wrong.
        It’s all following a strict script.
        That’s not what we’re made to do.
        We’re made to be our own person, we’re made to go off and do
        something that someone else hasn’t done before.

        Creativity is critical thinking and without
        it how are you going to open up and ask harder questions?
        Art opens up those… possibilities to think beyond what we already know.
