            Art history is the study of objects of art considered within their time period. Art historians analyze
            visual arts’ meaning (painting, sculpture, architecture) at the time they were created. Art history doesn’t
            consist in simply listing all the art movements and placing them on a timeline. It is the study of objects
            of art considered within their time period. Art historians analyze visual arts’ meaning (painting,
            sculpture, architecture) at the time they were created. Also, another of art history’s mission is to
            establishes authorial origins of artworks, i.e. discovering who created a particular artwork, when, when and
            for what reason.

            Iconography is a major part of art history. It consists in analyzing the symbolism of
            works of arts. For instance, art historians identify the visual elements of a painting and interpret its
            meaning. Art historians are interested in what the works of art represented at the time they were created.
            It is a way to learn about the civilizations of the past.
